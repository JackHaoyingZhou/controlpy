Controlpy
---------

A library for commonly used controls algorithms (e.g. creating LQR controllers). An alternative to Richard Murray's "control" package -- however, here we do not require Slycot.

The goals of this are:

1) Allow me to easily design control systems in Python

2) Learn some more about Python

3) Maybe provide something useful to other people.
